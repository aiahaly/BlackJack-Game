Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, my partner and I have been working together and coordinating the workload as best as we can. So far we have been able to get some graphics on the screen with widgets we created using tkinter. We also have managed to get the BlackJack Game playing in the terminal for a short period of time.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still have yet to get the music added to the beckground as you play the game. Also, we are working on getting a better animation to appear on screen and getting the cards to move on the screen as well. We are hoping to create more animations and more graphics on screen when the game is being played.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
We are having issues getting the cards to move on the screen so as of right now the goal is tp just get the cards to appeear on screen. We are having issues using Pip and Pil and downloading the softwares to our computers which is making the use of graphics a little more  difficult.
