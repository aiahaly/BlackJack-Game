# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

BlackJack Excel

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Hope to write a python code to create a BlackJack Game where cards appear on screen. The game will prompt the user to play against the computer and possibly an actual person given two different terminals.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The BlackJack game will use a GUI to simulate a game between the player and computer. When the user initializes the game, the GUI will appear on the screen and will have  moving graphics, hopefully. In this GUI, a  virtual bank($1000) will either appear on screen or in the terminal and the user will be prompted. The user can then choose any amount of this money to bet in the terminal against the computer and once the user reaches $0 it will kill the game. May prompt the user if they want to play again at the end of the game in the terminal/GUI.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome is getting the terminal to run properly and possibly adding background music or a shuffling sound when the dealer shuffles the deck. We will get an animated graphic on screen that calls the usersâ€™ cards and has them appear in the GUI. We will get a code  built that plays the entirety of the Blackjack game correctly and knows when to kill the terminal/game.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome of this project would be the implementation of a start over button and Hit button on screen as well.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for this project is that we will have developed a graphic visual demonstration of the card game, Black Jack, where the user is able to interact with and play the game. There may also be a multiplayer option, where a second player can fully interact with and compete against a first player. Creating a multiplayer game without including the computer is the best outcome for this project.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Moving forward, I will research more about PIP and animated graphics in order to incorporate in myproject. We will both be working on the GUI together however, I will be building the actual BlackJack game and making sure the game runs properly. Chris will be responsible for providing the actual code to allow the graphics to be able to move and appear on the screen. Later on when the time comes we will both be working on the moving animations and possibly creating a multiplayer game.
